## What is Sky?

Sky is a new way to build high performance, cross platform mobile apps. More
specifically, Sky is a rendering engine, a scripting engine, an (optional)
framework, and an (optional) set of
[Material Design](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html)
widgets. Sky is optimized for today's and tomorrow's mobile devices. It is
focused on low-latency input and high frame rates on Android and iOS.

The dartlang plugin currently contains functionality related to creating and
running Sky projects. We plan to move that out into a separate plugin in the
future.

## Creating Sky projects

In order to create a Sky project, run the `'create sky project'` Atom command.
This will create a new Dart project with dependencies on the `sky` and
`sky_tools` packages. It'll also create the entry-point to the Sky app,
`lib/main.dart`. That file should look something like this:

    import 'package:sky/widgets.dart';

    void main() => runApp(new HelloWorldApp());

    class HelloWorldApp extends App {
      Widget build() {
        return new Scaffold(
            toolbar: new ToolBar(center: new Text("Sky Demo")),
            body: new Material(child: new Center(child: new Text("Hello world!"))),
            floatingActionButton: new FloatingActionButton(
                child: new Icon(type: 'content/add', size: 24)));
      }
    }

## Setting up your mobile device

In order to run a Sky app, you'll need the Android `adb` tool installed, an
Android device connected via USB, and to have your mobile device in developer
mode. See this
[page](https://github.com/domokit/sky_engine/blob/master/sky/packages/sky/README.md#setting-up-your-android-device)
for more details about setting up your Android device.

## Running a Sky project

Once your device is set up, execute the `'run sky application'` command. This
will launch your app on the device:

<img src="img/sky_launch.png" width="45%" class="img-centered"/>

If your phone does not have the Sky APK on it, one will be automatically
installed. You should see your app running on the device now:

<img src="img/sky_screen.png" width="30%" class="img-centered"/>

The Atom plugin uses the `sky_tool` installed with the `sky` plugin to launch
your app. You can run this tool by hand as well. Try making a change to the
application's source, and then from the command-line, run:

    ./packages/sky/sky_tool start

You should see the app re-launch on the mobile device with the new changes. Run:

    ./packages/sky/sky_tool -h

in order to see a list of other available commands.
