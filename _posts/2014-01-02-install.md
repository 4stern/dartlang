- Install [Atom](https://atom.io/)
- Install the [linter][https://atom.io/packages/linter] package (with
  `apm install linter` or through the Atom UI)
- Install this [dartlang][https://atom.io/packages/dartlang] package (with
  `apm install dartlang` or through the Atom UI)

The plugin should auto-detect the Dart SDK location. If not, you can set it
manually in the plugin configuration page (`Preferences > Packages > dartlang`).

### Optional packages

We recommend the following (optional) packages:

- [last-cursor-position](https://atom.io/packages/last-cursor-position) helps you
  move between cursor location history (useful when using "jump to definition").

### Packages to avoid

We do not recommend using both [emmet](https://atom.io/packages/emmet) and the
dartlang package together. Editing large .dart files slows down if you have the
emmet plugin installed. We have filed an
[issue](https://github.com/emmetio/emmet-atom/issues/319).
