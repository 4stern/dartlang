## Installing

- install Atom ([atom.io](https://atom.io/))
- install the [linter](https://atom.io/packages/linter) package (through the
  `Atom > Preferencesâ€¦` menu item or with `apm install linter`)
- install the [dartlang](https://atom.io/packages/dartlang) package

The plugin should auto-detect the Dart SDK location. If not, you can set it
manually in the plugin configuration page (`Preferences > Packages > dartlang`).

## Optional packages

[last-cursor-position](https://atom.io/packages/last-cursor-position) helps you
move between cursor location history (useful when using the `'jump to declaration'`
command).

## Packages to avoid

We do not recommend using both [emmet](https://atom.io/packages/emmet) and the
dartlang package together. Editing large .dart files slows down if you have the
emmet plugin installed. You can track the issue
[here](https://github.com/emmetio/emmet-atom/issues/319).
