## What is Flutter?

Flutter is a new project to help developers build high-performance,
high-fidelity, cross-platform mobile apps.

The dartlang plugin currently contains functionality related to creating and
running Flutter projects. We plan to move that out into a separate plugin in the
future.

## Getting Flutter

See the [Flutter getting started](http://flutter.io/getting-started/) guide for
how to get set up. In a nutshell, you'll need to:

- clone the Flutter git repository
- add the `flutter/bin` directory to your OS path

And from Atom, open the `dartlang` plugin's preferences and set the Flutter SDK
path to where the Flutter repo was cloned locally.

## Creating Flutter projects

In order to create a Flutter project, run the Flutter `'create project'` Atom
command. This will create a new Dart project with a dependency on the `flutter`
package. It'll also create the entry-point to the Flutter app, `lib/main.dart`.
That file should look something like this:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(
    new MaterialApp(
      title: "Flutter Demo",
      routes: {
        '/': (RouteArguments args) => new FlutterDemo()
      }
    )
  );
}

class FlutterDemo extends StatelessComponent {
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return new Scaffold(
      toolBar: new ToolBar(
        center: new Text("Flutter Demo")
      ),
      body: new Material(
        child: new Center(
          child: new Text("Hello world!")
        )
      ),
      floatingActionButton: new FloatingActionButton(
        child: new Icon(
          icon: 'content/add'
        )
      )
    );
  }
}
```

## Setting up your mobile device

In order to run a Flutter app, you'll need the Android `adb` tool installed, an
Android device connected via USB, and to have your mobile device in developer
mode. See this
[page](https://flutter.github.io/getting-started/index.html#setting-up-your-android-device)
for more details about setting up your Android device.

## Running a Flutter project

Once your device is set up, execute the `'run application'` command. This will
launch your app on the device. If your phone does not have the Flutter APK on
it, one will be automatically installed. You should see your app running on the
device:

<img src="img/flutter_screen.png" width="30%" class="img-centered"/>

The Atom plugin uses the `flutter` command installed with the `flutter` package
to launch your app. You can run this tool by hand as well. Try making a change to
the application's source, and then from the command-line, run:

    flutter start

You should see the app re-launch on the mobile device with the new changes. Run:

    flutter -h

in order to see a list of other available commands.
