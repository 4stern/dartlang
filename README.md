## Developing

To work on `atom-dartlang-experimental`:

- install [Atom](https://atom.io/)
- clone this repo
- from the repo directory, type `apm link`
- re-start Atom

The plugin will be active in your copy of Atom.

When making changes:

- `type type type...`
- from the command line, run `grind build`. This will re-compile the javascript.
- from atom, hit `ctrl-option-command-l`. This will re-start atom.
